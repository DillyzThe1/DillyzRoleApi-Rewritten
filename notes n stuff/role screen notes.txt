judging by the "your role is role text" image, i've concluded a few things:

- TeamTitle, BackgroundBar, ImpostorName, ImpostorText, ImpostorTitle, & YouAreText are all useless in the role system (judging from experience, they're for the team stuff)
- RoleText is the text pertaining to your role (duh). Such as "Engineer", "Scientist", or "Shapeshifter".
- RoleBlurbText is the text pertaining to one's description, such as "You're an Engineer you idiot, YOU'VE PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE. STOP READING."
- It is unknown how to change the "your role is" text, which may cause a problem for color. I must look into it.
