# DillyzRoleApi-Rewritten
 A full rewrite for DillyzRoleApi, made for v2022.12.14 & up!<br>
*NOTE: DillyzRoleApi v2.2.0 for Among Us v2023.2.28 will be in the works by April.*
 
# Installation
## Mod Manager
Head over to the [mod manager's releases page](https://github.com/DillyzThe1/DRAPI-Mod-Manager/releases) & download the installer exe.<br>
If windows warns you about the program, remember that this is fully open source so you can read what you don't trust. Just hit run anyway.<br>
Follow through the installation and open up the program (likely through your desktop icon).<br>
Install the client with the "reinstall" button and browse mods.<br>
Hit "launch" and wait for the first boot-up procedure to happen.<br>
Enjoy!<br>
<br>
*Note: you must always launch through the launcher to get the modded variant of Among Us running.*
## Manually
Clone your Among Us install folder.<br>
In the clone of the install folder, do either method A or B:<br>
<br>
Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/DillyzThe1/DillyzRoleApi-Rewritten/releases/latest/">latest release</a> and download [`DillyzRoleApi_2.x.x_BepInExBundle.zip`](../../releases/download/2.0.0/DillyzRoleApi_2.0.0_BepInExBundle.zip).<br>
Extract the files and put it in your Among Us install's clone.<br>
Boot up the game using the exe in the Among Us clone.

## Roles & Mods
You may download the API alongside and officially recognized mods that have been listed over at [DRAPI-Mod-Manager](https://github.com/DillyzThe1/DRAPI-Mod-Manager/releases/latest/).<br>
*NOTE: "Official" is relevant to me as the API and mod manager creator, as I state that I am not associated with Innersloth.*
Please use the mod manager rather than manual downloads.<br>
If you wish to have a mod you like added to the launcher, [submit an issue](https://github.com/DillyzThe1/DRAPI-Mod-Manager/issues/new) in the [appropiate repository](https://github.com/DillyzThe1/DRAPI-Mod-Manager) detailing the mod name and functionality so I can reach out to the developer.<br>
<br>
All official role packs and mods will be included in the BepInEx bundle.<br>
Source code to each mod:
- [ClassicRolePackage](https://github.com/DillyzThe1/ClassicRolePackage)
- [DillyzLegacyPack](https://github.com/DillyzThe1/DillyzLegacyPack)

*Note: "Official" means developed by DillyzThe1, who owns the API and the associated launcher. See disclaimer below.*
